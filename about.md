This blog is meant to be a way to publish notes on academic subjects (mainly in ML, stats).
Posts will be written with the objective of clear exposition of theory through intuitive explanations and demonstrations.

This blog is not meant to be a stamp collecting project where I copy a bunch of material from other sources 
and stamp it off as my own, having learned nothing along the way.

Inspired by the creative and hard work of pedagogies that made me feel smarter than I am.
